# Pupillometer Processing Pipeline

## Overview

The `pupillometer_pipeline` package is a processing pipeline for pupillometer data, designed to clean and smooth data using functional data analysis. It is built to take in pupillometer data from participants in a longitudinal study, where pupil trajectories are collected from both sets of eyes at each timepoint. Due to technologic, human, and other sources of errors, there is the potential for a pupil trajectory to fail to capture a pupil trajectory accurately. Thus, there is the potential for multiple trials to be collected at a singular timepoint for an eye. Our processing pipeline uses a novel method to classify a "best" pupil trajectory, and smooth them accordingly. Functionality is built into the pipeline for users to manually view trajectories and switch the classification as seen fit. 

The overall pipeline is described in (insert Suni's paper here), in the application of examining pupillary trajectories of participants from three cannabis use-groups pre and post cannabis consumption.
